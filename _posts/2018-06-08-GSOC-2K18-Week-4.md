GSOC'18 Coding Period Week 4: 03 June 2018- 09 June 2018


Last week we added some functionality including docstrings to nmlimport library.

This week I worked on sphinx error caused by outdated extension, resuulting PR has been [merged here](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2tools/pull/18). Few other corrections were made to our nmlimport library and pushed to our current PR.

Apart from that we uploaded a conda recipe for libNeuroML library as we are using it in our nmlimport library. Here is the [corresponding PR](https://github.com/kapilkd13/staged-recipes/blob/libneuroml/recipes/libneuroml/meta.yaml). I also added a Test script to test multiple .nml file against our lirary for its morphology information, see [script here](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2tools/pull/17/commits/22111ea8fa09199a6154f16ae9d36f8b9c066253).

Next week I would be working on improving test script, enhancing libneuroml conda recipe and adding segment group information to our lirary. We ill try to get our PR merged after correcting few issues like proximal  distance absence etc.

Keep Coding!!
