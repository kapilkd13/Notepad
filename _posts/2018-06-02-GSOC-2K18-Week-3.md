GSOC'18 Coding Period Week: 26 May 2018- 02 June 2018


Last week we added basic functionality to nmlimport library. This week we continued our work on this library.

This week I developed test suite for our module. We also added docstring to our module, this will be used to generate documentation for our module via sphinx. I pushed my current progress onto brian2tools repository. Here is the [corresponding PR](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2tools/pull/17).

Apart from that we made few corrections and added our module to Travis for testing and integration. The  [PR to libNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML/pull/70) library removing syntax causing warning in Python 3 has been merged.

Next week I would be working on sphinx error correction caused by outdated extension, design and upload conda recipe for libNeuroML to conda-forge repository. A command line script to test multiple .nml files has to be made along with few other corrections to our library. 

Keep Coding!!
