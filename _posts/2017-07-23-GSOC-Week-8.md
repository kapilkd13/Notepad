GSOC'17 Eighth Week: 16 June 2017- 23 July 2017


This week we merged our windows compatibility branch. And with that cwltool is officially windows compatible. Here is the final [PR](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/419).  
There were some minor changes like better formatting and improving variable names. After that we [added  warning](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/492) when default container for windows is referenced suggesting users to embed a custom Docker within their workflow file.  
We added [documentation for windows](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/486) users of cwltool which includes some common problems they may encounter  while setting up there docker on windows.  
My mentors have suggested me some interesting bugs/features that I can work on from now on. Some of the issues are `setting up some tests for cwltool`, `allowing http/s files as input` and `running cwltool from within Jupyter Notebook`.  
I hope it would continue to be a interesting and informative journey.
