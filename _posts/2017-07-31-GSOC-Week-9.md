GSOC'17 Ninth Week: 24 July 2017- 31 July 2017


We started this week with improving the `Windows compatibility` documentation. With the help of my mentors we made it clean, clear and concise. Now it looks much better. We merged this PR and Here is the [Documentation](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/blob/master/windowsdoc.md).

We also added a test to the `default container warning` feature which gives warning to users when default docker container on windows is used. Here is the [PR](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/492).

Later we started Python3 testing for cwltool on Windows (on Appveyor). Here is the related [PR](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/503)

On cwltool we added a feature to `force pull` latest docker image mentioned with `dockerpull` variable even if a image is locally present. We can do this using a `--docker-pull` command line argument. Here is the corresponding [PR](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/506)

We will continue to work on some other issues and features in the upcoming week.
