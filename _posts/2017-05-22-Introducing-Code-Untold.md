After my selection in GSOC'17, where I would be working with Common Workflow Language Organization which participated under Open Bio Foundation. I am required to write blog weekly/bi-weekly depending on the content.  
For me this looks like a good opportunity to start my own blog, which I always wanted to do. So here is my blog "Code Untold". I would be sharing GSOC posts and my other coding experience here.
