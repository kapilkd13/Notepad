GSOC'17 First Week: 29 May 2017- 5 June 2017

First week of GSOC'17 coding period has ended. And it's time to look at the progress I made in this week.  

This week I worked on making schema-salad windows compatible. My first half of the week went in understanding the problems that prevented us from running schema-salad on
windows platform. It was more of a research work. Some of the problems were:  
* **Unsupported Scheme**: Function like `urlsplit` splits windows path and assumes windows Drive name as schemes.  
* **Windows path separator**: Windows and unix use different path separator which caused problems. But why Windows use different path separator, [see here](https://www.howtogeek.com/181774/why-windows-uses-backslashes-and-everything-else-uses-forward-slashes/)  

In second half of the week I solved these problems and the result is this PR. Now schema-salad is passing all tests on windows OS.  
Finally I added status badges for windows(Appveyor) and unix(Travis) on our schema-salad repository.
 
In the second week I will be working on making cwltool windows compatible. I will push my work [here](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/414).
