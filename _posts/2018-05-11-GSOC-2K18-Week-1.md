GSOC'18 Community Bonding Week: 5 May 2018- 11 May 2018


As I mentioned in previous blog, we had multiple parsing libraries like Pylems, libNeuroML at our disposal for parsing .nml file. We chose libNeuroML for now.

This week I familiarized myself with libNeuroML library. I went through their documentation. They have also written some use case examples that were really helpful. here is a link to them. I also introduced myself to its core developers and they are willing to help in issues related to libNeuroML.

Later I created issue page on brian2tools github repo listing milestones to be achieved as part of this project. This issue page would be used to discuss on further ideas/issues and to track my progress. here is a link to this page.

I have started working on library to import morphologies from a .nml file into Brian. In coming weeks I will be working on implementing this library.

Will be back with next weekâ€™s update.
