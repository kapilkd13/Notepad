GSOC'18 Coding Period Week 1: 12 May 2018- 18 May 2018


This week marked the begining of official coding period. Although I started coding in last week itself. This week I carried on in it.

This week I had a hangout meeting with my mentor Marcel Stimberg where we discussed the progress and future plans related to the project. We eliminated few of the issues and with that the project's progress looks good.

We were able to extract morphology information from a .nml file. Here is a link to the [corresponding ipython notebook](https://gist.github.com/kapilkd13/2751c8aa7bad70394c4137b6f2ecfcc3) .

This week I would create nmlimport library and will try to push the progress on brian2tools repository for merging.

Happy Coding!!
