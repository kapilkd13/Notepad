This year I would be working on **Importing NeuroML morphologies into Brian** as part of GSOC 2k18. Thanks INCF for this opportunity!!
Brian is a free, open source simulator for spiking neural networks. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, highly flexible and easily extensible. It is a simulator designed to save processing time and to ease the work of scientists. As part of my project I would be adding support to import morphologies from a NeuroML file into Brian simulator. You can find more about this project [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5942238354341888)  
This is the first week of commumity bonding period it has been great so far. As suggested by my mentor [Marcel Stimberg](https://github.com/mstimberg) I introduced myself and my project on Brian's Community group.  
Apart from that this week I established my work environment. This includes setting PYlems, JNeuroML, libNeuroML and NEURON simulator. I decided to post my weekly progress on both medium and [my own Blog](http://codeuntold.in/) hosted on github. we decided to use [brian2tools](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2tools) repository for project related discussions as all the development will take place in this repository.  
I spent a handsome amount of time in analyzing multiple tools (namely JneuroML, Pylems and liNeuroML) available for parsing NeuroML file. From what I found libNeuroML best meets our requirement and I would focus on it now. A nice document explaining libNeuroML and PYlems is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4005938/).

While setting up JNeuroML I found some issues and have [submitted a PR](https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML/pull/57) fixing it.  
Next week I would e working on libNeuroML, understanding the best way to use it for our use case.  

Hoping for an eventful and interesting GSOC 2k18!!.
