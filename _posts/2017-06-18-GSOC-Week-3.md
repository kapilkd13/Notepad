GSOC'17 Third Week: 12 June 2017- 18 June 2017


This week we passed all cwltool's test on Windows Operating System(Good News!). here is the [Pull Request](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/419)  
I started with remaining issues that I was facing in ensuring windows compatibility for cwltool. Since `InplaceUpdate`, an extension
of Cwltool uses `symlinks` inherently, we decided to skip all tests that uses `InplaceUpdate` feature.

Thereafter I worked on other errors. Some of the reasons for these errros were `File paths` not being handled
properly as windows have slightly different path structure and different character encoding on windows and unix platform. This bug actually took some time as in some testcases we were comparing 
`checksum` of output file and although the output looked same across all platform, the `checksum` was wrong. It was funny, when I realized that newline character would have different bit encoding on windows and unix platform.
Solution was to avoid such characters.

There was some `mypy` problem which I resolved with the help of Manvendra.  

This week I would be working on
* Checking how docker responds to cwltool's windows implemetation.
* Figure out a way to run conformance test on some Windows based CI, preferebly `Appveyor`.
